>> If your Windows has the extension option disabled, then after creating a new notepad file, the file name will be tw.
# Creating a new notepad file with the file named tw.txt when extension option is disabled is equivalent as creating a notepad file named tw.txt.txt.
>> If your Windows has the extension option enabled, then after creating a new notepad file, the file name will be tw.txt.
